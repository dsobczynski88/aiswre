      "\n",
      "1. **Every Pod gets its own IP address**: This allows Pods to communicate with each other directly using these IPs, facilitating easy communication without the need for Network Address Translation (NAT).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Flat Network Structure**: All Pods can communicate with all other Pods in the cluster, allowing for more straightforward service discovery and connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Services**: Kubernetes uses the Service abstraction to provide stable endpoints and load balancing for accessing sets of Pods. Different types of Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName) define how access is routed and made available both internally and externally.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Network Policies**: These enable fine-grained control over traffic policies and rules applied to Pods, allowing you to restrict which Pods can communicate with each other.\n",

      "5. **Container Network Interface (CNI)**: Kubernetes relies on CNI plugins to manage network resources and configuration, ensuring compatibility with multiple networking systems.\n",
