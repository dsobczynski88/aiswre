      " The INCOSE Guide to Writing Requirements is a practical handbook from the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) that explains how to write clear, testable, and consistent requirements. It complements the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 standard by turning its principles into concrete rules, examples, and checklists. It’s used across industries (aerospace, defense, automotive, medical, IT) by authors, reviewers, and managers.\n",
      "\n",
      "What the guide covers\n",
      "- Purpose and scope: How to craft individual requirements and sets of requirements so they are understandable, implementable, and verifiable.\n",
      "- Roles: Guidance for authors, reviewers, approvers; how to structure reviews and quality checks.\n",
      "- Patterns and examples: Model sentences, good/bad examples, and rewrite patterns for common requirement types (functional, performance, interface, constraint, quality, safety).\n",
      "- Checklists and rules: Language rules, formatting, attributes/metadata, and verification planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key characteristics of a good requirement (individual)\n",
      "- Necessary: It’s needed to meet a parent need or constraint; traceable to a source.\n",
      "- Correct: States the right intent without contradicting higher-level requirements.\n",
      "- Unambiguous: Only one plausible interpretation; avoids vague terms.\n",
      "- Singular: One requirement per statement (no compound “and/or” conditions).\n",
      "- Feasible/Attainable: Realistic within constraints (technology, cost, schedule).\n",
      "- Verifiable: Pass/fail criteria and a verification method are clear.\n",
      "- Complete: Contains all needed conditions, thresholds, units, and context.\n",
      "- Appropriate to level/implementation-free: States “what,” not “how,” at the current level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key characteristics of a set of requirements\n",
      "- Complete: Covers all needed capabilities and constraints.\n",
      "- Consistent: No internal conflicts; harmonized terminology and units.\n",
      "- Non-redundant: No duplicates or overlaps that can cause divergence.\n",
      "- Modifiable/Traceable: Organized, uniquely identified, and change-controlled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Language and style rules the guide emphasizes\n",
      "- Use “shall” for binding requirements. Use “should” for goals/recommendations, and “will” for statements of fact or external events (not to impose requirements).\n",
      "- Write in active voice with a clear subject (e.g., “The system shall …”).\n",
      "- One requirement per sentence; avoid chained clauses and “and/or.”\n",
      "- Quantify everything: include measurable criteria, units, tolerances, and time bounds.\n",
      "- Express conditions explicitly: “When/If <condition>, the system shall <response> …”\n",
      "- Avoid vague or subjective words: fast, user-friendly, robust, minimize, optimize, adequate, appropriate, as necessary, as soon as possible, etc.\n",
      "- Avoid open-ended terms: etc., including but not limited to, and/or, TBS. If you must use TBD/TBR, control them with tracking, due dates, and resolution criteria.\n",
      "- Avoid ambiguous references (this, these, it) without clear antecedents; define acronyms and domain terms in a glossary and use them consistently.\n",
      "- Keep rationale separate from the requirement text; store it in an attribute/field.\n",
      "- Align each requirement with a verification method: Test, Analysis, Inspection, or Demonstration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended structure of a requirement statement\n",
      "- [Context/condition] [Subject] shall [action/result] [object] [quantified criteria with units and tolerances] [time/trigger].\n",
      "- Example:\n",
      "  - Weak: “The device shall be low power.”\n",
      "  - Strong: “In steady-state operation, the device shall consume less than 2.5 W at 25 °C and 12 V input.”\n",
      "  - With condition: “When mains power is lost, the controller shall save the current configuration to non-volatile memory within 100 ms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Attributes/metadata the guide recommends managing\n",
      "- Unique ID, title/short name\n",
      "- Requirement text\n",
      "- Source and rationale\n",
      "- Verification method and success criteria\n",
      "- Priority/criticality and risk\n",
      "- Owner, status, version, change history\n",
      "- Trace links (parents, children, interfaces, hazards, test cases)\n",
      "\n",
      "Typical pitfalls the guide warns about\n",
      "- Combining multiple requirements in one sentence.\n",
      "- Negatives that hide the real need (“shall not fail”) instead of specifying required behavior under fault conditions.\n",
      "- Unbounded performance (“minimize weight”) without a target.\n",
      "- Inconsistent or missing units, significant figures, or environmental conditions.\n",
      "- Level mismatch (design decisions embedded in higher-level requirements).\n",
      "- Interface requirements that refer to unspecified external behaviors or undefined protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "How it relates to other practices\n",
      "- Aligns with ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 requirements quality characteristics.\n",
      "- Works with model-based systems engineering (e.g., SysML); even with models, clear textual requirements remain essential.\n",
      "- Plays well with patterns such as EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) for trigger-response phrasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Availability\n",
      "- Published by the INCOSE Requirements Working Group. The guide is periodically updated and is available from INCOSE; many organizations use it for training and as a review checklist.\n",
      "\n",

Is it actually needed at this level?\\n- Right level of abstraction: States “what” for this level (no premature design), or, if it must constrain design, is the rationale clear and approved?\\n- Context and conditions: Are operating modes, environmental conditions, and preconditions explicit (temp, voltage, state, load, network conditions)?\\n- Values and units sanity check:\\n  - Threshold vs. objective correct? Direction correct (min/max/<=/>=)?\\n  - Units consistent with parent budgets and interfaces; conversions checked.\\n  - Significant figures and tolerances realistic and testable.\\n- Alignment with allocations/budgets: Do numbers roll down correctly from parent performance budgets and constraints? Any double-counting or gaps?\\n- Feasibility: Technically achievable with current technology and margins; compatible with schedule/cost/risk.\\n- Interfaces precise: External items named with version/ID; data types, ranges, and protocols defined or referenced precisely.\\n- Standards/references: Cited by exact identifier and revision; referenced clauses match the intended behavior.\\n- Exceptions/faults: Does it define behavior under relevant faults or edge cases, or is there a linked requirement that does?\\n\\nPass 3 — Verifiability and conflict checks\\n- Pass/fail interpretation: Can a tester decide unambiguously if it passes? Sketch a test or analysis in one or two sentences.\\n- Verification method fit: Chosen method (T/A/I/D) is appropriate and feasible; required facilities/instruments exist.\\n- Boundary tests: Identify boundary values and worst-case conditions; ensure requirement can be verified there.\\n- Consistency: No conflict with peer requirements (same set and interfacing items); terminology and units consistent.\\n- Redundancy: Not duplicating another requirement; if similar, ensure they don’t diverge or contradict.\\n- TBD/TBR control: Any placeholders have owners, due dates, and resolution criteria.\\n\\nQuick checklist you can apply to any single requirement\\n1) Who is the subject? (“The [item] shall …”)\\n2) Under what condition/mode? (“When/If/While …”)\\n3) What outcome/result is required? (state the “what,” not the “how”)\\n4) How much/how well, with units/tolerances/time bounds?\\n5) Where did this come from? (trace to source/parent; is it necessary?)\\n6) Is it feasible with current budgets/architecture?\\n7) Are interfaces/standards referenced precisely (name, ID, version)?\\n8) Is the wording free of ambiguity and open-ended terms?\\n9) What is the verification method, and what would the pass/fail test look like?\\n10) Any conflicts or duplicates with other requirements?\\n\\nSimple accuracy aids\\n- Paraphrase test: Have two reviewers independently restate the requirement in their own words; differences reveal ambiguity/errors.\\n- EARS reframe: Restate as “When <trigger>, the <item> shall <response> within <time/criteria>” to expose missing conditions or measures.\\n- Boundary walkthrough: Check extremes of environment/inputs for hidden constraints.\\n- Unit/number sanity check: Recalculate conversions; compare to known performance and parent allocations.\\n- Adversarial read: Ask, “Could this be satisfied in an unintended way?” If yes, tighten it.\\n\\nExample (condensed)\\nOriginal: “The controller shall save data quickly during power loss.”\\nReview outcome:\\n- Add subject/measure/condition: “When input voltage drops below 10.0 V for more than 2 ms, the controller shall commit the current configuration to non-volatile memory within 100 ms without data corruption.”\\n- Check accuracy: 10.0 V/2 ms threshold matches power budget and hold-up time; 100 ms aligns with memory write time plus margin; “data corruption” defined elsewhere; verification by test with controlled brownout; no conflicts with shutdown sequence requirement.\\n\\nDeliverables from the review\\n- Marked-up requirement (or rewritten version)\\n- Recorded findings: defects, questions, TBDs, conflicts\\n- Proposed verification method and sketch of acceptance\\n- Traceability updates (source link, parent allocation)\\n- Decision: accept, revise, split, or defer with TBR/TBD controls\\n\\nIf you share a few of your requirements, I can run this review method on them and show the before/after along with the specific issues found.', type='output_text', logprobs=[])], role='assistant', status='completed', type='message')], parallel_tool_calls=True, temperature=1.0, tool_choice='auto', tools=[], top_p=1.0, background=False, conversation=None, max_output_tokens=None, max_tool_calls=None, previous_response_id='resp_0df66ba03729e3a30068f05491d634819388cef289a7a23e6c', prompt=None, prompt_cache_key=None, reasoning=Reasoning(effort='medium', generate_summary=None, summary=None), safety_identifier=None, service_tier='default', status='completed', text=ResponseTextConfig(format=ResponseFormatText(type='text'), verbosity='medium'), top_logprobs=0, truncation='disabled', usage=ResponseUsage(input_tokens=2049, input_tokens_details=InputTokensDetails(cached_tokens=1024), output_tokens=2254, output_tokens_details=OutputTokensDetails(reasoning_tokens=1088), total_tokens=4303), user=None, billing={'payer': 'developer'}, store=True)"
