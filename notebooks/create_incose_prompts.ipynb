    "Here’s a practical, lightweight way to review a requirement for accuracy, aligned with the INCOSE Guide’s Section 4 rules and quality characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparation (what to have in hand)\n",
    "- Source: stakeholder need, parent requirement, contract/standard, hazard/mission need.\n",
    "- Context: operational scenarios/modes, interface definitions, architecture or allocation, performance budgets, environmental ranges.\n",
    "- Verification approach: intended method (Test/Analysis/Inspection/Demonstration) and acceptance criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three-pass review method\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass 1 — Language and structure (quick screen)\n",
    "- Subject and shall: Does the statement name the item (e.g., “The system”) and use “shall” for the requirement?\n",
    "- One per requirement: Is there only one enforceable statement (no and/or, chained clauses)?\n",
    "- Positive, active, clear: Prefer positive statements with explicit trigger/condition (“When/If…”).\n",
    "- Measurable: Are there concrete, measurable criteria with units, tolerances, and time bounds?\n",
    "- Unambiguous wording: No vague terms (robust, user-friendly, minimize, as necessary), no open-ended “etc.” or “including but not limited to,” no undefined acronyms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass 2 — Technical correctness and completeness (accuracy)\n",
    "- Trace and necessity: Is it traceable to a valid source/parent? Is it actually needed at this level?\n",
    "- Right level of abstraction: States “what” for this level (no premature design), or, if it must constrain design, is the rationale clear and approved?\n",
    "- Context and conditions: Are operating modes, environmental conditions, and preconditions explicit (temp, voltage, state, load, network conditions)?\n",
    "- Values and units sanity check:\n",
    "  - Threshold vs. objective correct? Direction correct (min/max/<=/>=)?\n",
    "  - Units consistent with parent budgets and interfaces; conversions checked.\n",
    "  - Significant figures and tolerances realistic and testable.\n",
    "- Alignment with allocations/budgets: Do numbers roll down correctly from parent performance budgets and constraints? Any double-counting or gaps?\n",
    "- Feasibility: Technically achievable with current technology and margins; compatible with schedule/cost/risk.\n",
    "- Interfaces precise: External items named with version/ID; data types, ranges, and protocols defined or referenced precisely.\n",
    "- Standards/references: Cited by exact identifier and revision; referenced clauses match the intended behavior.\n",
    "- Exceptions/faults: Does it define behavior under relevant faults or edge cases, or is there a linked requirement that does?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass 3 — Verifiability and conflict checks\n",
    "- Pass/fail interpretation: Can a tester decide unambiguously if it passes? Sketch a test or analysis in one or two sentences.\n",
    "- Verification method fit: Chosen method (T/A/I/D) is appropriate and feasible; required facilities/instruments exist.\n",
    "- Boundary tests: Identify boundary values and worst-case conditions; ensure requirement can be verified there.\n",
    "- Consistency: No conflict with peer requirements (same set and interfacing items); terminology and units consistent.\n",
    "- Redundancy: Not duplicating another requirement; if similar, ensure they don’t diverge or contradict.\n",
    "- TBD/TBR control: Any placeholders have owners, due dates, and resolution criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick checklist you can apply to any single requirement\n",
    "1) Who is the subject? (“The [item] shall …”)\n",
    "2) Under what condition/mode? (“When/If/While …”)\n",
    "3) What outcome/result is required? (state the “what,” not the “how”)\n",
    "4) How much/how well, with units/tolerances/time bounds?\n",
    "5) Where did this come from? (trace to source/parent; is it necessary?)\n",
    "6) Is it feasible with current budgets/architecture?\n",
    "7) Are interfaces/standards referenced precisely (name, ID, version)?\n",
    "8) Is the wording free of ambiguity and open-ended terms?\n",
    "9) What is the verification method, and what would the pass/fail test look like?\n",
    "10) Any conflicts or duplicates with other requirements?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple accuracy aids\n",
    "- Paraphrase test: Have two reviewers independently restate the requirement in their own words; differences reveal ambiguity/errors.\n",
    "- EARS reframe: Restate as “When <trigger>, the <item> shall <response> within <time/criteria>” to expose missing conditions or measures.\n",
    "- Boundary walkthrough: Check extremes of environment/inputs for hidden constraints.\n",
    "- Unit/number sanity check: Recalculate conversions; compare to known performance and parent allocations.\n",
    "- Adversarial read: Ask, “Could this be satisfied in an unintended way?” If yes, tighten it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (condensed)\n",
    "Original: “The controller shall save data quickly during power loss.”\n",
    "Review outcome:\n",
    "- Add subject/measure/condition: “When input voltage drops below 10.0 V for more than 2 ms, the controller shall commit the current configuration to non-volatile memory within 100 ms without data corruption.”\n",
    "- Check accuracy: 10.0 V/2 ms threshold matches power budget and hold-up time; 100 ms aligns with memory write time plus margin; “data corruption” defined elsewhere; verification by test with controlled brownout; no conflicts with shutdown sequence requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliverables from the review\n",
    "- Marked-up requirement (or rewritten version)\n",
    "- Recorded findings: defects, questions, TBDs, conflicts\n",
    "- Proposed verification method and sketch of acceptance\n",
    "- Traceability updates (source link, parent allocation)\n",
    "- Decision: accept, revise, split, or defer with TBR/TBD controls\n",
