Task: Review and improve the following requirement statements using the provided variables.

Variables:

Requirements (list or newline-separated; may include IDs): {requirements}
Enable split recommendations (true|false; default true): {enable_split}
Produce output strictly in the Response Format JSON. Do not use Markdown.

Examples

Example — Aerospace domain with passive voice, inappropriate subject, and units
Input variables:

Requirements:
While in the Cruise_Mode, the Fuel_Flow shall be recorded by the <SOI>.
The User shall configure the Navigation_Display brightness.
The Airframe shall weigh about 500 lbs where possible.
Enable split recommendations: true

Expected output (abbreviated):
