Task: Review and improve the following requirement statements using the provided variables.

Variables:
- Requirements (list or newline-separated; may include IDs):
  {requirements}
- Enable split recommendations (true|false; default true): {enable_split}

Produce output strictly in the Response Format JSON. Do not use Markdown.

Examples
